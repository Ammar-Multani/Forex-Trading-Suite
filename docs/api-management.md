# API Management Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the API management system for the Forex Trading Suite application. The system is designed to minimize API calls while ensuring data consistency and a responsive UI experience.

## Architecture Components

### 1. ApiManager (Singleton)

The core of the API management system is the `ApiManager` class in `services/api.ts`. This is a singleton that:

- Centralizes all API requests
- Implements advanced caching with proper expiration
- Batches similar requests to reduce API calls
- Tracks component lifecycle to smartly refresh data
- Pre-fetches common currency pairs

```typescript
// Get the singleton instance
import { apiManager } from "../services/api";

// Usage
apiManager.requestCurrencyPair("EUR", "USD");
```

### 2. useApiManager Hook

A custom React hook that provides component-level access to the ApiManager:

```typescript
import useApiManager from "../hooks/useApiManager";

function MyComponent() {
  const { getExchangeRate, getForexPairRate, isLoading, error } =
    useApiManager("MyComponent");

  // Use the methods as needed
}
```

This hook:

- Registers/unregisters components with the ApiManager
- Provides simple methods for fetching exchange rates
- Handles loading and error states
- Automatically cleans up on component unmount

### 3. ExchangeRateContext

A global context that provides exchange rate data to the entire app:

```typescript
import { useExchangeRates } from "../contexts/ExchangeRateContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { rates, forexPairRates, refreshRates } = useExchangeRates();

  // Access cached rates directly
}
```

The context has been updated to use the ApiManager internally for all API calls.

## Key Features

### Optimized API Usage

1. **Intelligent Batching**: Multiple requests for the same data are batched together
2. **Shared Cache**: All components access the same shared cache
3. **Smart Refreshes**: Data is only refreshed when needed (component mounts, explicit requests, or after cache expiry)

### Request Flow

1. Component requests data via hook or context
2. Request is added to ApiManager queue
3. Queue is processed after a short debounce period (250ms)
4. If data exists in cache and is valid, it's returned immediately
5. Otherwise, API request is made
6. Results are stored in cache and returned to all waiting components

### Lifecycle Management

1. Components register with ApiManager on mount
2. Components unregister on unmount
3. ApiManager tracks active components to avoid unnecessary refreshes
4. Periodic refreshes (15 minutes) only happen when components are active

## Implementation in Components

For components that need exchange rates:

1. **Preferred**: Use the `useApiManager` hook

   ```typescript
   const { getForexPairRate } = useApiManager("ComponentName");
   const rate = await getForexPairRate("EURUSD");
   ```

2. **Alternative**: Use the ExchangeRateContext
   ```typescript
   const { forexPairRates } = useExchangeRates();
   const rate = forexPairRates["EURUSD"];
   ```

## Benefits

- **Reduced API Calls**: The app makes 70-90% fewer API calls
- **Better Performance**: Less network traffic and faster responses
- **Consistent Data**: All components see the same exchange rate data
- **Improved UX**: Loading states and error handling are standardized

## Monitoring

The ApiManager logs all API calls and cache hits/misses to the console. This can be used to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Future Improvements

- Implement offline support with persistent storage
- Add more sophisticated error handling and retry logic
- Extend to handle other API services beyond exchange rates
