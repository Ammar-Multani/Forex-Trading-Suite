# App Size Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the optimizations applied to reduce the app size.

## JavaScript Bundle Optimizations

1. **Metro Configuration**: Updated `metro.config.ts` to:

   - Enable minification with `drop_console` and `drop_debugger` in production
   - Disable source maps in production builds

2. **Babel Configuration**: Updated `babel.config.ts` to:

   - Remove console logs in production builds using `transform-remove-console`

3. **Bundle Analysis**: Added script to analyze bundle size and identify large dependencies.

## Asset Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**: Created a script to optimize PNG and JPG assets by:

   - Resizing large images to a maximum dimension of 1024px
   - Compressing images to reduce file size while maintaining quality

2. **Asset Bundle Patterns**: Updated `app.json` to only include necessary assets:
   - Limited asset bundling to fonts and images that are actually used

## Android-Specific Optimizations

1. **ProGuard Configuration**: Enhanced ProGuard rules to:

   - Remove debug logs in release builds
   - Optimize code for faster app startup
   - Keep only necessary classes and methods
   - Set proper optimization passes

2. **Production Builds**: Updated build scripts to:
   - Use app bundles instead of APKs for production builds
   - Configure proper Gradle options for size optimization

## Build Process Optimizations

1. **Environment Configuration**: Added cross-env to ensure production builds use proper environment variables:

   - Ensures minification is enabled
   - Disables development features in production

2. **Hermes JavaScript Engine**: Confirmed Hermes is enabled in app.json for better performance and smaller bundle size.

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**: Consider implementing dynamic imports for rarely used features
2. **Dependency Audit**: Review and remove unused dependencies
3. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused code is properly eliminated from the bundle
4. **Font Subsetting**: Consider subsetting fonts to include only used characters
5. **Runtime Version Control**: Enabled runtime version policy in app.json for better updates management
