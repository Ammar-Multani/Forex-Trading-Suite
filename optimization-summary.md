# App Size Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the optimizations applied to reduce the app size for both Android and iOS platforms.

## JavaScript Bundle Optimizations

1. **Metro Configuration**: Updated `metro.config.ts` to:

   - Enable minification with `drop_console` and `drop_debugger` in production
   - Disable source maps in production builds

2. **Babel Configuration**: Updated `babel.config.ts` to:

   - Remove console logs in production builds using `transform-remove-console`

3. **Bundle Analysis**: Added script to analyze bundle size and identify large dependencies.

## Asset Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**: Created a script to optimize PNG and JPG assets by:

   - Resizing large images to a maximum dimension of 1024px
   - Compressing images to reduce file size while maintaining quality

2. **Asset Bundle Patterns**: Updated `app.json` to only include necessary assets:
   - Limited asset bundling to fonts and images that are actually used

## Android-Specific Optimizations

1. **ProGuard Configuration**: Enhanced ProGuard rules to:

   - Remove debug logs in release builds
   - Optimize code for faster app startup
   - Keep only necessary classes and methods
   - Set proper optimization passes

2. **Production Builds**: Updated build scripts to:

   - Use app bundles instead of APKs for production builds
   - Configure proper Gradle options for size optimization

3. **Resource Shrinking**: Enabled resource shrinking in release builds using:
   - `enableShrinkResourcesInReleaseBuilds` in build properties
   - Configured appropriate SDK versions for optimization

## iOS-Specific Optimizations

1. **Build Settings**: Configured iOS build settings for optimization:

   - Disabled bitcode which increases binary size
   - Set `useFrameworks` to static for better size optimization
   - Set minimum deployment target to 14.0 to avoid backward compatibility code
   - Removed unused background modes and encryption settings

2. **Production Configurations**: Added dedicated build profiles for iOS:

   - Configured EAS build settings for optimized iOS builds
   - Added scripts to run optimized iOS builds with proper environment variables

3. **Framework Optimization**: Configured framework handling:
   - Used static frameworks to reduce binary size
   - Configured proper resource class for builds

## Build Process Optimizations

1. **Environment Configuration**: Added cross-env to ensure production builds use proper environment variables:

   - Ensures minification is enabled
   - Disables development features in production

2. **Hermes JavaScript Engine**: Confirmed Hermes is enabled in app.json for better performance and smaller bundle size on both platforms.

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**: Consider implementing dynamic imports for rarely used features
2. **Dependency Audit**: Review and remove unused dependencies
3. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused code is properly eliminated from the bundle
4. **Font Subsetting**: Consider subsetting fonts to include only used characters
5. **Runtime Version Control**: Enabled runtime version policy in app.json for better updates management
6. **App Thinning for iOS**: Consider implementing app thinning for iOS to further reduce app size for specific device targets
